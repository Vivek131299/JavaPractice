Static vs Instance Variables : 


Static variables:

Declared by using the keyword static.
Static variables are also known as static member variables.
Every instance of that class shares the same static variables (Staic variabes are shared among instances).
If changes are made to that variable, all other instances will see the effect of the change.

Static variabes are not used very often but can sometimes be very useful.
For example when reading user input using Scanner we will declare scanner as a static variable. 
That way static methods can access it directly.


Instance variables:

They don't use the static keyword.
They are also known as fields or member variables.
Instance variables belongs to specific instance of a class.

Every instance has its own copy of an instance variable.
Every instance can have a different value(state).
Instance variabes represent the state of an instance.
