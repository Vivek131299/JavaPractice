Static vs Instance Methods :


Static Methods : 

Static methods are declared using a static modifier.
Static methods can't access instance methods and instance variables directly.
They are usually used for operations that don't require any data from an instance 
of the class(from 'this'). The 'this' keyword is the current instance of the class.

In static methods we can't use the 'this' keyword.
Wnenever you see a method that does not use instance variables that method should be declared 
as a static method.
For example main is a static method and it is called by the JVM when it starts an application.

Static methods are called as ClassName.methodName(); if in another class, 
or methodName; only if in same class.


Instance Methods :

Instance method belongs to an instance of a class.
To use an instance method we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the new keyword.

Instance methods can access instance methods and instance variables directly.
Instance methods can also access static methods and static variables directly.


Deciding which method to use:
If method uses any fields(instance variables) or instance methods, 
then it should be a instance method. Otherwise it should be a static method.
